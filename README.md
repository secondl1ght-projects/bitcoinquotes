To have a bitcoin quote added it must have some kind of insight, meaning or significance in bitcoins technology or history. I know this is somewhat subjective, but if you are a bitcoiner you should understand what might be a good addition into this collection.

If you would like a new quote added and you do not know basic JavaScript, you can request the quote be added by submitting an issue. Make sure there are 3 components to your request:
- Quote
- Speaker
- Date of quote
- URL to source of quote (if it was not posted on the internet this can be a link to a video of the person saying it)

If you would like to add a new quote and you know some basic JavaScript, you can submit a PR. Add a new `object` to the `quoteArray` in `scripts.js`. Each `object` needs to have the following `keys`:
- `text`
- `speaker`
- `date`
- `url`

Please title your commits and PRs using 'Add quote from [speaker]'.

Any other ideas beyond adding new quotes are also welcome. :)
