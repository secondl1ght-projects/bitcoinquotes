To have a bitcoin quote added it must have some kind of insight, meaning or significance in bitcoins technology or history. I know this is somewhat subjective, but if you are a bitcoiner you should understand what might be a good addition into this collection.

If you would like a new quote added and you do not know basic JavaScript you can request the quote be added by submitting an issue. Make sure there are 3 components to your request:
[x] Quote
[x] Speaker
[x] Date of quote
[x] URL to source of quote (if it was not posted on the internet this can be a link to a video of the person saying it)

If you would like to add a new quote and you know some basic JavaScript you can submit a PR, add a new `object` to the `quoteArray` in `scripts.js`. Each `object` needs to have the following `keys`:
[x] `text`
[x] `speaker`
[x] `date`
[x] `url`

Please title your commits and PRs using 'Add quote from <speaker>'.

Any other ideas beyond adding new quotes are also welcome. :)
